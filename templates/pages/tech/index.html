<p>Nearly everything here was shot on a 2005 Nikon D2Hs.
A few photos were taken with a 2006 Nikon D200, and a
few were taken with a 2004 Canon EOS 1D Mark II.
</p>

<p>I used an 18-70mm DX lens on the Nikon cameras for most
photographs. Low-light photos usually use the Nikon 50mm
f/1.8 D. All photographs from the EOS 1D were with Canon's
cheapest 50mm f/1.8 EF lens.
