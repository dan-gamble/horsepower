 <p>I request, but do not require, that you <strong>save the
 full-resolution versions of any photographs that you copy.</strong>
 The versions that you see displayed
 on any web page are reduced-sized and reduced-quality versions to make
 pages load quicker. Full resolution versions can be downloaded by
 following the link right underneath each photo's page. This ensures
 that you are working with the highest-resolution and best-quality
 photo possible. It also gives me free off-site backups! \o/
